    <h2>About SRS</h2>
    <h3>Has the time finally come to consider your options for ongoing supportive care?</h3>
    <p>Whether you are making the decisions for yourself, making it for a loved one or a client... the decision to move into any type of care facility is never going to be an easy one to make.</p>
    <p>It's true everyone's situation is different. Some people are fortunate enough to have the support of family to keep them at home (time and money to be a carer) or have unlimited finances to pay for in-home care.</p>
    <p>Sadly, this doesn't happen for everyone. When a person doesn't have the access to these advantages and experiences a lack of money, lack of family support or dedicated carer, they need to look for appropriate affordable alternative solutions.</p>
    <p>Nursing homes are not always a viable option because of critical bed shortages, age restrictions and depending on the level of care needed, it may not be what is needed.</p>
    <p>This is where Supported Residential Services (SRS) come in.</p>
    
    <h4>Have you ever considered SRS?</h4>
    <h4>Have you heard of them before?</h4>
    <p><strong>SRS</strong> are privately owned and operated businesses who provide their services without Government funding (Although they are highly regulated by the Government).</p>
    <p>They offer a great alternative solution to people who need assisted care and a supportive place to live.</p>
    <p>The decision to move into SRS can be made easier knowing the one you choose is well regarded in the industry because of its exceptional care, it's professionally managed and it has everything to make it feel like home.</p>
    
    <h3>Uniquely Different</h3>
    <p>The Unique design of Queens Lodge allows residents to live in Separate units, which is vastly different to other SRS facilities. It makes it feel more like a home and gives residents their own space which promotes a greater sense of independence.</p>
    <p>Of course, there is 24 hours a day supervision and daily cleaning to ensure their home is kept safe, clean and most importantly... homelike.</p>
    <p>Residents are encouraged to join in with our regular recreational activities. Some have even sold their artworks at art exhibitions. This has been a huge confidence boost for them.</p>
    <p>Because it's important to maintain good health as much as possible we have a number of health programs. We have the highest assisted resident participation in health incentives like accessing dental, podiatry and optical services and treatments (all free).</p>
    
    <h3>A Place to Call Home</h3>
    <p>At Queens Lodge our longest current resident is 27 Years and still going strong! we have become a home for people who were previously transient and had difficulty settling in elsewhere.</p>
    <p>The longevity of their stay of Queens Lodge is testament to how much they enjoy living here.</p>

            <h3>Queens Lodge</h3>
            <p>Queens Lodge is a 35 bed SRS specializing in psychiatric disabilities, intellectual disabilities, and acquired brain injury. We are considered to be one of the best pension level facilities in Victoria. This is due to our quality of care, advocacy, and the assistance we offer to our residents.</p>
            <p>Our Objective is to give residents the space to function as independently as their disability allows, in a homelike environment.</p>
            <p>We encourage creativity and group activities both on and off premises.</p>
            <p>There is a zero tolerance to alcohol, drugs, physical assault, and damage to property.</p>
            <p>Queens lodge prides itself on the service we deliver to our residents, but realistically... we are not for everyone.</p>
            <h3>Who are we right for?</h3>
            <p>We mainly care for people with psychiatric disabilities, intellectual disabilities, and acquired brain injury. Because we are a pension level SRS, we rely solely on the resident's fees to provide the services we do. Therefore, residents on the Disability Support Pension need to show a good credit history and payment reliability before being accepted as a resident.</p>
            <p>We are perfect for people who want to live a productive and independent life but would struggle to do so on their own without assistance.</p>
            <p>At Queens lodge we have "House Rules" in place to ensure all the residents are able to feel comfortable in their own home. This is important to us and our residents. Unfortunately, when people can't or won't comply with out simple, common sense "House Rules" then they aren't the right fit.</p>
            <h3>Now, Who are we wrong for?</h3>
            <p>We receive many referrals, but we need to carefully screen all applicants to check for compatibility. People with serious drug and alcohol abuse or a forensic psychiatric background cannot be admitted due to our duty of care to our current residents.</p>
            <p>We cannot accept people are violent or destroy property as this is a safety hazard to our other residents who deserve to live in a safe and supportive environment. (Many are vulnerable enough already.)</p>
            <p>Also, people with a poor credit history and an inability to pay their fees will not be admitted. This is to ensure our high standard of care to all our residents is never impacted by another person's inability, resistance, or reluctance to pay their fees.</p>
            <h3>Where we are</h3>
            <p>Queens Lodge is located in Lalor, Victoria.</p>
            <p>We're close to public transport, Lalor Library, Churches or various denominations, shopping areas and banks. We are also close to medical Facilities including hospitals, doctors and medical centres for your convenience and peace of mind

        <section id="fees">
            <h2>Fees</h2>
            <h3>What do I get for my fees?</h3>
            <p>At Queens Lodge we offer (All included in your fees)</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Nutritious Health meals cooked on-site. Meals are varied to accommodate all tastes.</li>
                <li>Personal laundry service (Other facilities charge extra for this service... we don't)</li>
                <li>Cleaning of room and unit</li>
                <li>Clean linen and towels</li>
                <li>Medication administration</li>
                <li>Emergency buzzers in every room</li>
                <li>Basic toiletries such as soap, shampoo, toothpaste, and toothbrush are provided</li>
                <li>24-hour supervision (Staff sleep over at night)</li>
                <li>Free in-house ART activities</li>
                <li>Personal training by a professional fitness trainer once a week</li>
                <li>Weekly massage therapist</li>
                <li>Wi-Fi Available</li>
            </ul>
            <p>With all these services included in the fees, there is little to pay for. The rising cost of living makes it incredibly difficult for some members of the community to manage what little they get in their pensions. Queens Lodge helps people who would normally be able to manage a place on their own live a very comfortable life. It really is a great alternative to trying to pay rent, utility bills, food and removes the everyday stress or trying to look after yourself with limited resources.</p>
            <h3>What are the fees?</h3>
            <p>As of July 2020, fees start from $800 per fortnight (paid in advance) depending on care needs. There is an annual fee increase. When you compare this to current rental fees (in the area which are between $320 and $400 per week), paying utilities, food and toiletries, and other expenses... the fees at Queens Lodge are very reasonable and affordable. And the best part is, someone cleans after you and helps you when you need it.</p>
