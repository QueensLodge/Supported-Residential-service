            <h2>Fees</h2>
            <h3>What do I get for my fees?</h3>
            <p>At Queens Lodge we offer (All included in your fees)</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Nutritious Health meals cooked on-site. Meals are varied to accommodate all tastes.</li>
                <li>Personal laundry service (Other facilities charge extra for this service... we don't)</li>
                <li>Cleaning of room and unit</li>
                <li>Clean linen and towels</li>
                <li>Medication administration</li>
                <li>Emergency buzzers in every room</li>
                <li>Basic toiletries such as soap, shampoo, toothpaste, and toothbrush are provided</li>
                <li>24-hour supervision (Staff sleep over at night)</li>
                <li>Free in-house ART activities</li>
                <li>Personal training by a professional fitness trainer once a week</li>
                <li>Weekly massage therapist</li>
                <li>Wi-Fi Available</li>
            </ul>
            <p>With all these services included in the fees, there is little to pay for. The rising cost of living makes it incredibly difficult for some members of the community to manage what little they get in their pensions. Queens Lodge helps people who would normally be able to manage a place on their own live a very comfortable life. It really is a great alternative to trying to pay rent, utility bills, food and removes the everyday stress or trying to look after yourself with limited resources.</p>
            <h3>What are the fees?</h3>
            <p>As of July 2020, fees start from $800 per fortnight (paid in advance) depending on care needs. There is an annual fee increase. When you compare this to current rental fees (in the area which are between $320 and $400 per week), paying utilities, food and toiletries, and other expenses... the fees at Queens Lodge are very reasonable and affordable. And the best part is, someone cleans after you and helps you when you need it.</p>
